      The French created a resort during colonialism and utilized it to relax
      and swim. Vietnamese holidaymakers visit this resort on weekends and
      vacations. Regrettably, wars have devastated the entire road
      infrastructure that leads to Ba Dong Beach. The province of Tra Vinh is
      now assessing the potential of rebuilding the road infrastructure. The
      tourism bureau in Tra Vinh also intends to rehabilitate and exploit Ba
      Dong seaside resort, transforming it into a popular tourist destination in
      the Cuu Long River Delta.

      The Natural Beauty of Ba Dong Beach When you arrive at the oceanic site,
      you will be taken aback by the salty sea air, which is so different from
      the lovely scents of fruits that dominate the delta's surroundings. The
      beach's tourism potential was first realized in the early twentieth
      century when French colonialists constructed a hotel for local officials
      to spend their weekends. From the hotels and restaurants hidden among the
      whispering poplars in the sea breeze, you may gaze out to sea, where
      fleets of fishing boats toil away to bring back infinite riches to enrich
      the country. This resort offers a wide variety of fresh fish at
      unexpectedly low pricing. Numerous seafood restaurants along Ba Dong
      Beach, specializing in traditional southwestern Vietnamese cuisine caught
      straight from the sea. Crab sauce with bananas, carambola, girdle cakes or
      rice rolls, and boiling pork are all specialties. The beach is lined with
      bungalows and cots of various costs that allow visitors to relax and rest
      while listening to the rhythmic sound of undulating waves. On the beach,
      there are several sand dunes where you can play. A lighthouse, shrimp
      lakes, and small islets are among the other attractions here. You can fly
      kites, play sports, stroll amid various sand dunes, or ride motorbikes
      fast enough to enjoy thrills that are otherwise difficult to come by
      elsewhere on the beach that runs as far as the eye can see. You can sleep
      in "underground dwellings" erected during the war to dodge mortars and
      bullets when night falls. From above, they are shielded by lush foliage.
      An imposing mangrove forest may be found approximately 7 kilometers from
      the beach. The fresh and pure winds of a mild wind energize beachgoers. If
      the physical activities have left you hungry, there are a variety of
      culinary delights available directly on the beach.
