        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Tra Vinh's boulevards, one of the most beautiful towns in the Mekong
          Delta, are still lined with shade trees, harkening back to a bygone
          age. Tra Vinh is a peaceful spot to explore the Mekong's little-known
          Cambodian link, with more than 140 Khmer pagodas dotting the province.
          Now that big bridges connect it to Ben Tre and beyond, the town itself
          sees a little more tourist traffic. Tra Vinh province is home to
          around 300,000 ethnic Khmer. They may appear to be an inconspicuous
          minority since they all speak fluent Vietnamese and have no
          distinguishing dress or way of life. If you look a little closer,
          you'll find that Khmer culture is still alive and strong in certain
          regions of Vietnam. In Tra Vinh, there is also a tiny but active
          Chinese community, one of the few remaining in the Mekong Delta
          region.
        </p>

          Middle Pagoda (Van Ung Phong cung) on days 8, 9, 10; Chua Cay Xanh
          (Nien Phong Cung) in 2 days 15, 16; Giong Lon Pagoda (Minh Duc Cung)
