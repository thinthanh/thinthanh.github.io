        <p>

          commencement of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and has put in
          place a series of proactive, comprehensive steps to counteract the
          virus's spread within the country and prepare its public health
          institutions. Due to its previous experience with various epidemics,
          Vietnam is well-positioned to protect its citizens as well as visitors
          traveling through. Travelers to Vietnam may have questions regarding
          the virus's spread in the country, as well as the restrictions in
          place. The following is a comprehensive description of the COVID-19
          situation in Vietnam as it pertains to tourists.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prevent the spread of COVID-19, Vietnam is only allowing foreign
          experts and individuals traveling for official or diplomatic purposes
          into the country, who must undergo medical exams and a 21-day
          quarantine at their own expense. The Immigration Department of Vietnam
          has stated that all foreigners who entered Vietnam on visa exemptions,
          e-visas, or tourism visas after March 1, 2020 will be granted
          automatic stay extensions until May 30, 2021. Travellers who are still
          in the nation must notify local authorities, either through their
          landlords or hotels, of their temporary residency and submit Vietnam's
          online health declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visitors who arrived in the nation before March 1, 2020, may be
          eligible for an extension if they can present an official letter from
          their embassy or consulate saying that they were unable to leave for
          objective reasons (letter must be translated to Vietnamese). The
          extension is also available to foreigners who have been quarantined or
          treated in Vietnam for COVID-19. When they leave Vietnam, they must
          have their certification documents to show immigration officers.

        <h1>Precautions for travelers' health and safety</h1>
        <p>
          Visitors to Vietnam are advised to take reasonable measures against
          COVID-19 while on the country. The World Health Organization
          recommends the following simple precautions to protect yourself and
          your loved ones:<br />

          1. If you have a fever or a cough, don't travel. If you get a fever,
          cough, or trouble breathing, seek medical attention and inform them of
          your recent travel history.<br />

          2. Maintain a social chasm. Keep at least a metre away from others,
          especially if they are sneezing, coughing, or have a fever.<br />
          3. Hands should be washed with soap and water on a frequent basis. You
          may also spray your hands as often as you like with an alcohol-based
          hand sanitizer.<br />

          4. When you cough or sneeze, use a tissue to cover your mouth and
          nose. After coughing or sneezing, dispose of soiled tissues promptly
          and wash your hands.<br />

          5. Contact with living animals should be avoided. If you come into
          contact with live animals or animal products at marketplaces, wash
          your hands with soap and water.<br />

          6. Only eat food that has been thoroughly cooked. Ensure that your
          meals, particularly animal proteins and dairy products, are fully
          cooked and prepared in a hygienic manner.<br />
          7. Single-use masks should be discarded. If you use a single-use mask,
          make sure it covers your nose and mouth, don't touch it, and wash your
          hands after you take it off.
          <br />
          Anyone suffering signs of the virus, such as fever, cough, or trouble
          breathing, should contact Vietnam's health hotline at 19003228 right
          away.
