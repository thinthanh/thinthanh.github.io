    <p>
      With strong Khmer architecture, Vam Ray Pagoda is Vietnam's largest Khmer
      temple. Not just locals, but visitors from all over the world come to pray
      and visit this site. Vam Ray Pagoda's unique form and brilliant golden
      color immediately conjure up images of the Golden Temple's distant region.
      With its one-of-a-kind, award-winning architecture. The Vam Ray pagoda has
      helped to provide the Tra Vinh province's cultural tourist sector, as well
      as the Khmer Nam Bo pagoda system, a new face.<br />
      The Vam Ray Pagoda is Vietnam's largest Primitive Buddhist pagoda. The
      pagoda is constructed in the Angkor style of architecture. Vam Ray Hamlet
      is located in Ham Tan Commune, Tra Cu District, Tra Vinh Province. It has
      been around for more than 600 years. To preserve the relic, Mr. Tram Be, a
      Buddhist from the pagoda, funded the restoration and construction of a new
      structure for three years at a cost of one million dollars.

      The Vam Ray Pagoda is built in the Angkor architectural style, which is
      the pagoda's signature style. The pagoda features four gates, the main
      gate of which faces east, similar to the Khmer pagodas of the Mekong River
      Delta. The main gate is quite tall and large, and it is in the style of
      oriental temples' three-arched entrance gates, but the top is a layer of
      towers piled up. The entire gate is yellow in color. The gate's shape
      appears to be ancient and mysterious.

      An extremely tall pillar, supported by columns shaped like Naga God
      Snakes, stands in the center of Vam Ray Pagoda and is utilized for burning
      candles during festivals. Naga God Snake used to appear to Buddha and
      defend pagodas in Buddhist culture.

      Only a large Buddha statue, placed gravely in the highest position, can be
      found inside the Buddha. A few little Buddha statues have been relocated
      to a more accessible location. Everyone's attention is drawn to the Buddha
      by the basic worshipping style. The Buddha Temple has a wide, calm
      environment that makes Buddhists who are performing ceremonies feel
      comfortable. The Buddha statue traveling to Nirvana, with a length of 54
      meters and a foundation the size of a long two-story building, stands to
      the southeast of the Buddha Temple. The entire statue, including the base,
      is yellow. My heart gets light and easy when I see the Buddha laying
      peacefully in a peaceful area.

      Tourists that visit the Vam Ray Pagoda are informed about Tram Be, a
      Buddhist who donated a million dollars to renovate and rebuild the pagoda.
      The project began in 2003 and ended in 2008, much to the delight of the
      local Buddhist community. Mr., a guy with a nice heart, is worthy of
      respect. The Vam ray pagoda is located in a good traffic area. You may
      travel to Vam Ray Pagoda from Tra Vinh, Can Tho City, Ben Tre, or Soc
      Trang, among other places. It's fascinating to visit an old Angkor
      architectural style temple with the largest Khmer pagoda in Vietnam. When
      you decide to visit this unique location, you will not be sorry.
